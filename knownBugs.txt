Pentomino.java
- pentFits, placePent, putLeftTop: do not behave as expected in this context: left top position of pentomino will be evaluated as left top position of first filled cell in pentomino

Game.java
- fallPlace does not place the pentomino used in the bottom most location. Wrong code, see comments
